To get Webpage to work you need to run BOTH the bokeh server AND the flask python file, so conceptually:

1) bokeh serve capstone_dashboard.py &
2) python app.py &

But - they have different port numbers and the flask application needs to access the running app on localhost port 5006.   The bokeh server app is run on port 5006, and the flask app is run 
on port 5000.  So, we need to tell the bokeh server to allow it to be embedded in another server.  

So, in two different terminal/command windows, we need to run the following (one in each window, running(1) before running (2):

1) bokeh serve --allow-websocket-origin=localhost:5000 capstone_dashboard.py 
2) python app.py 


And finally check the webpage in localhost:5000
